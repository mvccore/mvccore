	 * - By route name and params array
	 *   (route name is key in routes configuration array, should be any string,
	 *   routes must have information about controller name and action name 
	 *   inside).
	 * Result address (url string) should have two forms:
	 * - Nice rewritten URL by routes configuration (for apps with URL rewrite 
	 *   support [Apache `.htaccess` or IIS URL rewrite module] and when first 
	 *   param is key in routes configuration array).
	 * - For all other cases is URL form like: 
	 *   `"index.php?controller=ctrlName&amp;action=actionName"`
	 *   (when first param is not founded in routes configuration array).
	 * Method tries to find any route between routes by first argument and if
	 * there is no route but if there is any pre route URL building handler 
	 * defined, the handler is called to assign desired routes from database 
	 * or any other place and then there is processed route search between 
	 * routes again. If there is still no routes, result url is completed 
	 * in query string form.
	 * @param  string              $controllerActionOrRouteName
	 * Should be `"Controller:Action"` combination 
	 * or just any route name as custom specific string.
	 * @param  array<string,mixed> $params
	 * Optional, array with params, key is 
	 * param name, value is param value.
	 * @throws \InvalidArgumentException
	 * @return string
